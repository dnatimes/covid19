# COVID-19 Host Genetics analysis

As a part of [COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative](https://covid19hg.netlify.com/), we perform the following set of analyses to better understand the genetic basis of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.

Please check out initial draft of host genetics of COVID-19, [Initial review and analysis of COVID-19 host genetics and associated phenotypes](https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0356.v1).

- [`HLA`](/HLA): HLA frequency in UK Biobank[2].
- [`ABO`](/ABO): The ABO blood type frequency in UK Biobank.
- [`snpnet`](/snpnet): Polygenic prediction of biomarkers and blood measurements. We deposit notebooks and scripts for polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis in this directory[3,4,5].
- [`PRS_PheWAS`](PRS_PheWAS): Application of blood measurement PRSs for disease risk prediction.

## Please share ABO blood type frequency in COVID-19 patients

We replicated recent findings in Zhao et al.[6] about the significant risk reduction of the blood group O across different control groups in UK Biobank. For a robust inference of risk factors, we would like to encourage a broad sharing of ABO blood type frequencies across (1) mild, (2) moderate, and (3) severe/critical COVID-19 cases at [https://tinyurl.com/abo-covid19](https://tinyurl.com/abo-covid19).

  - Please see the documentation in [`snpnet`](/snpnet) directory for more information.
- We developed [HLA/ABO frequency map](https://biobankengine.shinyapps.io/hla-map/) for visualization of the ABO bloodtype and HLA allelotype frequency data.

## Update log
- 2020/4/22: We make [UK Biobank](https://github.com/rivas-lab/covid19/tree/master/UKB_covid19_GWAS) analysis and summary statistics publicly available.
- 2020/4/3: We added summary for normalization of PRS.
- 2020/4/1: We released the updated PRS weights. Please see [`snpnet`](/snpnet) directory for more information.
- 2020/3/29: We added [two-digit HLA allelotype frequency information](/HLA).
- 2020/3/28: We updated the [HLA allelotype frequencies dataset](/HLA). It now includes the HLA allelotype frequencies across more than 100 countries/regions from UK Biobank, in addition to the [17th IHIW NGS HLA Data](http://17ihiw.org/17th-ihiw-ngs-hla-data/). We launched the [HLA map app](https://biobankengine.shinyapps.io/hla-map/) for vidualization of the frequency data.
- 2020/3/27: Our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0356.v1)[1] is [introduced in a news article in Science](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb9192).
- 2020/3/26: We updated the link to [COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative](https://covid19hg.netlify.com/).
- 2020/3/26: We added aggregated summary of Global frequencies of HLA allelotypes from the [17th IHIW NGS HLA Data](http://17ihiw.org/17th-ihiw-ngs-hla-data/) in [`HLA`](HLA). We thank Dr. Kazutoyo Osoegawa for reformatting and aggregation of the data. We updated the directory name of [`HLA`](HLA) from `UKB_HLA_freq`.
- 2020/3/24: [Our initial draft write-up is now posted on preprints.org](https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0356.v1).
- 2020/3/23: We added PRS evaluation plots and updated the documentation.
- 2020/3/22: We added results and source code for the PRS-PheWAS analysis [PRS_PheWAS](/PRS_PheWAS).
- 2020/3/22: We updated the documentation of the [ABO blood type analysis](/ABO).
- 2020/3/22: We made our initial draft of our host genetic analysis, [Initial review and analysis of COVID-19 host genetics and associated phenotypes](https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0356.v1) available at ~~Google Docs~~ (it is now available at Preprints.org).
- 2020/3/21: We added the [ABO blood type frequency reference](/ABO) across 9 population groups in UK Biobank (White British, Non-British white, African, South Asian, East Asian, self-reported Chinese, self-reported Indian, self-reported Pakistani, and self-reported Bangladeshi).
- 2020/3/20: We added a link to the [17th IHIW NGS HLA Data](http://17ihiw.org/17th-ihiw-ngs-hla-data/).
- 2020/3/19: We made an initial release of the polygenic risk score weights for 66 triats (blood measurements and biomarkers)! The weights of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are available at [Google Drive shared folder: https://bit.ly/rivas-lab_covid19_PRS_weights](https://bit.ly/rivas-lab_covid19_PRS_weights). Please see [`snpnet`](/snpnet) directory for more information. We are still running the PRS computations and we will make an update release when we have improved results.
- 2020/3/17: We updated the [HLA fequency reference](/HLA). It now includes the frequencies from 5 population groups.
